Combnoomb is a Discord bot that performs math operations in topics such as 
calculus, linearalgebra, etc. The purpose of creating this bot is that 
sometimes it can be a pain to check your answers when doing math on paper, 
so Combnoomb allows you to provide you some level of reassurance
if you need to check your answers. 

Linear Algebra operations the bot can do:
1. Matrix-Vector Product
    a. Tell Whether a Vector is an Eigenvector of a Matrix or not
    b. Rank of matrix
        a. Reduced row-echelon form of matrix. 
2. Dot Product of Two Vectors

Modules/Libraries Used:
1. discord 
2. numpy- Used this library to make addition/subtraction/multiplication/division on vectors more efficient.
3. turtle
4. asyncio
5. pickle
6. dotenv
7. os
